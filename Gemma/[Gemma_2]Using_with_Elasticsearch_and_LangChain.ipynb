        "\n",
        "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that combines large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. It involves two main components:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Retriever**: Based on the user's query, the retriever fetches relevant documents from a dataset to provide additional context to the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Generator**: The LLM uses the retrieved context along with the user's query to generate accurate and coherent responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "By combining retrieval with generation, RAG systems can produce responses that are both informed and coherent, making them ideal for tasks like question answering over custom datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "[**Gemma**](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open language models from Google. Built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models, Gemma models are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models (LLMs) available in English, with open weights, pre-trained variants, and instruction-tuned variants.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Gemma 2 9B IT Q6 K** model is a quantized instruction-tuned version of the Gemma model, optimized for performance while reducing computational load. This makes it possible to deploy the model in environments with limited resources, such as a laptop, desktop, or your own cloud infrastructure. It democratizes access to state-of-the-art AI models and fosters innovation for everyone.\n",
        "\n",
        "[**LangChain**](https://python.langchain.com/) is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides a suite of tools and integrations that simplify building complex AI applications, such as chatbots, question-answering systems, and more. LangChain allows you to chain together various components like prompts, LLMs, and retrievers to create sophisticated pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "[**Ollama**](https://ollama.ai/) is a tool that simplifies running language models locally. It allows you to manage and serve multiple models efficiently, making it easier to deploy and test AI models on your machine. With Ollama, you can switch between different models and versions seamlessly, providing flexibility in development and experimentation. You can browse the available Gemma 2 models at the [Ollama Gemma 2 Model Catalog](https://ollama.com/library/gemma2).\n",
        "\n",
        "[**Elasticsearch**](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) is a powerful open-source search and analytics engine. It allows you to store, search, and analyze large volumes of data quickly and in near real-time. In this tutorial, Elasticsearch serves as the data source and vector store for our RAG application, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant documents based on user queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "By combining these tools, you can build a local RAG application that leverages the strengths of each component to create a powerful AI application capable of handling tasks like question answering over custom datasets—all running locally on a modest GPU like the T4.\n",
